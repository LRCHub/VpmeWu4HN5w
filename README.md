```
Last night your name came up
in conversation
They were telling me
you'd found love
in a new location
And I swear my mind
went to the time
when you and I got faded
And I promised you we'd make it
Fast forward two years
and we were over
Ubered to the airport
when I know I shoulda drove ya
Later on I'd tell myself
that breaking up was worth it
But deep down
I'm still uncertain
What if, if we never let it go
What if,
we were way too young to know
What it was,
us just chilling like before
Tell me, wasn't that enough?
What if,
if you never left that night
What if, I never let you board
that flight
What if you,
if you could only read my mind
Maybe we'd still be in love
Last night your name came up
in conversation
Everybody singing his praises
This great new dude you dating
And I'm over you but I had a few
So it's probably true,
I was faded
(probably true, I was faded)
But damn it,
I just could not take it
(I just could not take it, oh)
I remember things were so good
when you were with me
But then I went
and broke your heart so bad
you moved up out the city
No hating, I'm so glad
that you're so happy now
But I wonder,
do you ever think about
What if, if we never let it go
What if,
we were way too young to know
What it was,
us just chilling like before
Tell me, wasn't that enough?
What if,
if you never left that night
What if, I never let you board
that flight
What if you,
if you could only read my mind
Maybe we'd still be in love
What if, ooh we never let it go
What if,
we were just too young to know
What it was,
just chilling like before
Wasn't that enough? Hey, yeah
What if,
if you never left that night
(never left that night)
What if, I never let you board
that flight
What if you (you, you, you),
if you could only read my mind
Maybe we'd still be in love
